Hello! Welcome to my Stroke Prediction project.

In this project, I will be using machine learning to create a logistic model that will predict whether a person has a stroke based on 
parameters such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, etc. I obtained this dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

I will be using Python with the scikitlearn framework and the following libraries: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
